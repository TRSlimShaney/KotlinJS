5/4/2020:   App is not functional as it originally relied on Kotlin threading, which KotlinJS does not support.
            However, other than that it transpiled completely.

5/5/2020:   Kotlin thread calls have been replaced with JS setInterval, which is functionally equivalent to what
            I had done before except it has it's own timer built in.  This means the game's logic is now fully ported
            over to JavaScript.  The previously used view PyQt5 based GUI is incompatible with browser JavaScript
            engines, so a new one will have to be written.  Given that I can write it in Kotlin, it should be much
            easier, and perhaps even more polished than the PyQt version.
