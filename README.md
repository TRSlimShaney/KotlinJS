KotlinJS seems really cool at first glance.  You can develop web apps with the convenience of programming in Kotlin.
Unfortunately, it requires you to embed a 2.2 MB kotlin.js script along with your transpiled JS.  This is really big
for a dependency.


build.bat will transpile the source on a Windows system.  You must have Kotlin added in your path.
pythonserver will start a python http server on a windows system  You must have Python added in your path.
The kt files are the Kotlin source files.
The main.js is the transpiled app.
