KotlinJS seems really cool at first glance.  You can develop web apps with the convenience of programming in Kotlin.
Well, it's not all that great actually.  First, it requires you to embed a 2.2 MB kotlin.js script along with your
transpiled JS.  Secondly, it also runs much slower than real JS.


build.bat will transpile the source on a Windows system.  You must have Kotlin added in your path.
pythonserver will start a python http server on a windows system  You must have Python added in your path.
The kt files are the Kotlin source files.
The main.js is the transpiled app.
